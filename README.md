# ZLOCK - Anti Virus

ZLOCK is an advanced anti virus plugin that secures your games from viruses, server side backdoors, and other malicious scripts. It uses a large table of keywords and names to detect as many unwanted instances as it can. The plugin has been tested against many malicious scripts/server side models on the toolbox and has detected just about everything I threw at it!

Features:
- Auto scan
- Full game scan
- Selection scan
- Editable settings for customizable scans (these will save)
- Deprecated/Bad code detection
- Update Checker (checks for new updates if available)

Version 1.3.5
